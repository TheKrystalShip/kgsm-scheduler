# Changelog

All notable changes to `kgsm-scheduler` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — headless deploys (`setup.sh` once, `deploy.sh` forever after)
- **`deploy/setup.sh` provisions the host once** (asks for sudo; idempotent): chowns
  `/opt/kgsm-scheduler` to the deploying user, seeds the env file, puts the real unit in
  `/etc/kgsm-scheduler/systemd/` with `/etc/systemd/system/kgsm-scheduler.service` symlinked to it,
  installs a polkit grant scoped to this project's units, enables the unit, and verifies the grant
  with the same unprivileged `systemctl` calls `deploy.sh` makes.
- **`deploy/deploy.sh` runs with no `sudo` and no prompts**, and refuses up-front (before building)
  with "run `deploy/setup.sh`" when the host is not provisioned. Post-deploy health is a real
  connect-and-read of the status socket, not just `systemctl is-active`.
- `deploy/deploy-common.sh` carries the project block plus the shared helpers, sourced by both entry
  points so they cannot drift. Canonical template and contract:
  `tks/scripts/deploy-template/README.md`.
- `artifacts/` (the deploy publish output) is now gitignored, matching every other repo.

### Added
- Auto-backup on scheduled restart: when `auto_backup_on_restart=true`, each scheduled
  restart now runs Stop → CreateBackup → PruneBackups(retention) → Start instead of a
  bare atomic watchdog RestartAsync. Backup failure is logged as a warning but does NOT
  prevent the instance from starting again.
- `SchedulerInstanceStatus.lastBackupUtc`, `lastBackupOk`, `lastBackupMessage` in the
  status socket output — lets kgsm-api surface the last backup result in the Settings tab.

## [1.0.0]

- Initial resident scheduler leaf: wall-clock scheduled restarts (daily / weekly / 6h)
  in each instance's IANA timezone, issued via the watchdog; NDJSON status socket.
